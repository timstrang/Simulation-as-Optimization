# Simulation-as-Optimization

This code is my contribution to the simulation as optimization project started by Sam Greydanus, who granted me access to much of the base code worked on here. The project is aimed at utilizing autograd features of the PyTorch package to simulate the dynamics of physical systems by direct action minimization.
